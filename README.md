You can map ports with the -p option. 

```
docker run -it -p 67:67 dhcp dhcpd
docker run -it -p 53:53 dns named
```

### 2. Bridged Network (type macvlan)
Follow the steps below.  
1. Create a network bridge.
1. Connect to your computer's network interface.
1. Create a docker network with macvlan type.
1. Specify the IP address, create a container, and start it.

### 3. Bridged Network (type bridge)
If you change the default settings of docker and make a bridge connection,  
you only need to specify the IP address.
